# EarlyDoc AI - An AI-Powered Disease Prediction & Diagnosis Assistant

## Overview

Early detection of diseases is crucial in preventing severe health complications. However, many individuals struggle with:
❌ Misinterpreting symptoms  
❌ Limited access to medical professionals  
❌ Slow self-research through unreliable sources  

To solve this, we present an **AI-powered Generative Health Diagnosis Assistant** that:
✅ Accepts user symptoms (Text/Voice)  
✅ Predicts possible diseases with confidence scores  
✅ Generates human-like explanations using GenAI  
✅ Suggests next steps (tests, urgency, doctor type)  
✅ Outputs structured JSON (API friendly)

---

## 🎯 Objective

Build a **conversational AI health assistant** powered by:
📊 Machine Learning (Symptom → Disease Prediction)  
🧠 LLM-based Explanation Generation  
🎙️ Voice Input + TTS Output  
📂 JSON-structured response for scalability
